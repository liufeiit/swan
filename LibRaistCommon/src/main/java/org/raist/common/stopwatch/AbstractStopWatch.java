     *   set(?, current) === started = started + getTick();

     *   started = current + ? - getTick(); 
     *   === 
     *   started = started + getTick();
     * so we just have to make sure:
     *   current + ? - getTick() == started + getTick();
     *   ? == started + getTick() + getTick() - current;
     *   ? == getTick() * 2 - (current - started);
     *   ? == getTick() * 2 - read(current);
     * 
     * so otherwise if the StopWatch is paused, how does it work?
